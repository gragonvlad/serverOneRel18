## Syntax of this helper
## First param must be number of to be used CPUs (only 1, 2, 3, 4 supported) or "offmesh" to recreate the special tiles from the OFFMESH_FILE
## Second param can be an additional filename for storing log
## Third param can be an addition filename for storing detailed log

## Additional Parameters to be forwarded to MoveMapGen, see mmaps/readme for instructions
PARAMS="--silent"

## Already a few map extracted, and don't care anymore
EXCLUDE_MAPS=""
#EXCLUDE_MAPS="0 1 530 571" # example to exclude the continents
#EXCLUDE_MAPS="13 25 29 35 37 42 44 169 451 598" # example to exclude 'junk' maps

## Exclude file
EXCLUDE_MAPS_FILE="mmap_excluded.txt"

## The Exclude file contains a space delimited list of map id's to skip in the same format as EXCLUDE_MAPS

## Does an exclude file exist ?
if [ "$EXCLUDE_MAPS" == "" ]
then 
  ## Exclude file provided?
  if [ -f "$EXCLUDE_MAPS_FILE" ]
  then ## Yes, read the file
    read -d -r EXCLUDE_MAPS < $EXCLUDE_MAPS_FILE
	echo "Excluded maps: $EXCLUDE_MAPS"
  else ## No, remind the user that they can create the file
	echo "Excluded maps: NONE (no file called '$EXCLUDE_MAPS_FILE' was found.)"
  fi

## Offmesh file
OFFMESH_FILE="offmesh.txt"

## Normal log file (if not overwritten by second param
LOG_FILE="MoveMapGen.log"
## Detailed log file
DETAIL_LOG_FILE="MoveMapGen_detailed.log"
